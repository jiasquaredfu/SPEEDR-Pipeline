# SPEEDR Background

Plastics represent a global health and ecological crisis due to their crystalline polymer structures being resistant to breakdown. Polyethelene Terephthalate (PET) is one of the most prevalent forms, comprising single use plastics like water bottles and grocery bags. Various enzymes have been isolated from microbes which have been found to degrade plastics, for example PETase and MHETase from the bacteria Ideonella sakaiensis. Although these microbes have evolved to metabolize synthetic polymers with high specificity, the enzymatic reaction is at too low activity to be utilized at industrial scale for bioremediation applications. The SPEEDR project from Collins Lab at MIT and the Wyss Institute at Harvard University applies directed protein evolution (DPE) to engineer PETase to function under target experimental conditions. The platform utilizes a Gaussian Process Bayesian Optimization (GPBO) model to predict beneficial mutations for the user's input optimization parameters. This machine learning algorithmn is trained on experimental data, will iteratively "guide" the sequence space search and reduce experimental burden by reducing the number of high-throughput screens.
